## Abstract
The did self method enables DID document management without registries. Each
DID owner is responsible for maintaining their DID documents and the corresponding
revision history.

## DID Method 
The name of this DID method is: `self`

The method specific identifier is represented as the hex-encoded value of the last 20 bytes
of a Ed25519 public key (akin to how Ethereum addresses are generated). 

## CRUD Operation Definitions
### Create
In order to create a DID, a key pair needs to be generated. The public key is the initial
DID `controller`. The create method generates a minimal DID document which is referred to as
the `genesis` document. The `genesis` document includes a proof generated using the controller's
key.    

A DID document for the `did:self:ad6a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd8a2` would look like this:

```
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/did/v1",
  "id": "did:self:ad6a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd8a2",
  "publicKey": [{
    "id": "did:self:ad6a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd8a2#key1",
    "type: "ED25519SignatureVerification",
    "owner: "did:self:ad6a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd8a2",
    "publicKeyBase64": ""
  },
  "authentication": [{
       "type": "ED25519SigningAuthentication",
       "publicKey": "did:self:ad6a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd8a2#key1"
  }],
  "proof": {
    type: 'Ed25519Signature2018',
    created: '2020-05-30T11:32:14Z',
    jws: 'eyJhbGc..',
    proofPurpose: 'assertionMethod',
    verificationMethod: 'did:self:ad6a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd8a2#key1'
  }
}
```

### Update
The update method, replaces an existing DID document with a new one. In order to distinguish the various versions of each DID document, we append to the `id` field a `serial number` (preceded by
the `#` symbol) which is increased by one every time a new version of the document is generated. The DID document with serial number `1` must include a proof that can be verified by the authentication key of the `genesis` document, whereas any DID document with serial number `X|X>1` must include a proof that can be verified by the authentication key of the document that corresponds to serial number `X-1`.

An update to the genesis document of `did:self:ad6a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd8a2`, that modifies
the authentication key would look like this:
```
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/did/v1",
  "id": "did:self:ad6a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd8a2#1",
  "publicKey": [{
    "id": "did:self:ad6a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd8a2#key2",
    "type: "ED25519SignatureVerification",
    "owner: "did:self:ad6a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd8a2",
    "publicKeyBase64": ""
  },
  "authentication": [{
       "type": "ED25519SigningAuthentication",
       "publicKey": "did:self:ad6a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd8a2#key2"
  }],
  "proof": {
    type: 'Ed25519Signature2018',
    created: '2020-06-1T11:32:14Z',
    jws: 'ab3hbGc..',
    proofPurpose: 'assertionMethod',
    verificationMethod: 'did:self:ad6a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd8a2#key1'
  }
}
```
Note that `id` is appended with `#1` and the proof has been generated using the key of the genesis document. 

### Read
The Read method receives as input a DID and a list of all DID documents that correspond to that DID (created using the create and then the update method). The documents in the list are sorted by their
serial number, in ascending order. Therefore the first element of the list is the genesis document, followed by the first update, and so forth. The last document of the list the and the one that corresponds to the DID. In order to verify the validity of that document, the following algorithm is executed. 

```
let top b the index of the last document in the list
for (x = top; x > 0; x-- )
{
  assert document[x].id == DID + "#" + x
  assert document[x].proof.verificationMethod ==
     document[x-1].authentication.publickey
  assert document[x].proof is valid
} 

/*
 * x= 0 so now we verify the genesis document
 */
assert document[x].id == DID 
assert document[x].id == last 20 bytes of document[x].authentication.publickey
assert document[x].proof.verificationMethod ==
     document[x].authentication.publickey
assert document[x].proof is valid
```
The fist assertion checks if documents serial numbers are decreased by one.
The second and the third assertions verify the hash chain.
The last four assertions verify the validity of the genesis block:
they validate that this is the genesis document of the given DID, as well 
as the the DID has been generated by the authentication key, which is also
used for generating the genesis documents' proof.

### Deactivate
DIDs are deactivated using the update method and by providing a new DID document that does not include the `authentication` field. Using this
approach, the ownership of the corresponding DID cannot be verified, and the DID document can not be further updated.
